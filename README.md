# Keras and convolutional networks intro

Notebook for a guest seminar I held in Gyorgy Ottucsak's Data science course at BME.

Based on [Aurelien Geron's repo](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2), which contains the example code of the second edition of his O'Reilly book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (forthcoming).

See more details in the notebook.
